We want users to choose Basic or Pro plan right away from the Home page before
clicking Sign Up

Memberships
*User should see link for Basic Plan on home page.
*User should see link for Pro plan on home page.
* Basic Plan link should point to regular Devise Sign up form.
* Pro Plan link should point to custom sign up form.

Stripe integration
* Users should have a Stripe customer token in their users table
* Javascript should prevent Pro form from submitting when user fills it out,
and should  send card info to Stripe.  Stripe will return a card token.
* Javscript should send user fields and card token to our Rails app. Rails app 
should validate the user fields. Rails app will note whether user is Plan 1 or Plan 2.
* Once validated, Rails should send user info (email, plan id) and card token to 
Stripe server and Stripe will create a subscription and send back a customer token.
Rails should save customer token and user info to our database.
